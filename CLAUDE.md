# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Current state

`owlsperch` is a Python (uv-managed) pipeline. As of batch B3 it has: the
`owlsperch` CLI and package (`pipeline/owlsperch/`), the curated PDF manifest
(`pipeline/manifest.yaml`), `manifest check`, `text` (column-repaired
per-page text extraction for text-layer books, plus a `.meta.json` sidecar
of paragraph font-size stats), `segment` (splits a book's text into
candidate spell/stat_block/feat/table/rules_section segments), and CI.
Everything else is a future-batch stub (`validate`, `build-db`,
`check-completeness`, `coverage`, `schema review`, `sample`).

### Commands

Run from the repo root (a uv workspace with `pipeline` as its only member --
see the comment in the root `pyproject.toml`):

```sh
uv sync                              # install deps
uv run owlsperch manifest check
uv run owlsperch text <book_id|all> [--force] [--pages A-B]
uv run owlsperch segment <book_id|all> [--force] [--pages A-B]
uv run ruff check .
uv run ruff format --check .
uv run mypy pipeline
uv run pytest pipeline/tests         # run all tests
uv run pytest pipeline/tests/test_manifest.py::test_35_book_is_in_scope  # single test
```

Some tests are marked `@pytest.mark.corpus`: they run `manifest check`,
`text`, and `segment` on page ranges of the real Player's Handbook (book_id
`phb1`), against the real `$OWLSPERCH_PDFS`/`~/D_D` directory and
`pdftotext` (poppler); they are skipped (not failed) when the corpus or
`pdftotext` isn't present.

### Architecture

- `pipeline/owlsperch/manifest.py` -- the `ManifestEntry` pydantic schema,
  YAML loading/validation (raises `ManifestError` naming the offending
  book_id and field), in-scope/status derivation, and the `manifest check`
  report.
- `pipeline/owlsperch/cli.py` / `__main__.py` -- the `owlsperch` argparse CLI.
- `pipeline/manifest.yaml` -- the curated manifest: one entry per file in
  `$OWLSPERCH_PDFS`, with judgment calls marked by a plain `#` comment and
  genuinely uncertain ones marked `# REVIEW:`.
- `pipeline/owlsperch/text/` -- the `text` subcommand: `bbox.py` parses
  `pdftotext -bbox-layout` XHTML (stripping invalid XML control characters
  a handful of real PDFs' fonts produce); `columns.py` reconstructs reading
  order (column clustering, wide-block column breaks, rotated marginalia
  dropped, and table-group detection); `cleanup.py` removes running
  headers/footers, detects printed page numbers, and rejoins hyphenated
  line breaks; `runner.py` orchestrates the `pdftotext` subprocess and
  writes `text/<book_id>/p{NNNN}.txt` + `p{NNNN}.meta.json` (per-paragraph
  `kind`/`median_word_height`/`max_word_height`/`line_count`, for
  `segment`'s heading detection) + `pages.json` under `$OWLSPERCH_DATA`.
  `wordlist.txt` is the bundled fallback word list used by dehyphenation.
  Table detection excludes prose-like blocks from grouping, requires
  mutual (not merely transitive) vertical overlap among a candidate
  group's blocks -- overlap of at least 70% of the shorter block's height
  *and* at least 50% of the taller block's height, and at least 2
  non-blank lines to even be a candidate -- and -- for a single block
  whose gappy rows split into long, sentence-like cells (median > 4
  words/cell) rather than short table cells -- splits that block into
  separate column blocks at the gap instead of reading it row-wise. The
  two-sided overlap test (not just the shorter block's) is what rejects a
  short, single-line block (e.g. a heading) that happens to sit fully
  nested inside a much taller neighboring block's y-range (e.g. PHB pp.
  197, 204's "Acid Fog" heading between the "Acid Splash"/"Air Walk" stat
  blocks) without a real row-aligned table underneath it. Known remaining
  real-corpus limitation: this does *not* catch the case where several
  real, unrelated blocks of *similar* height and short, label:value-style
  lines (e.g. two or three side-by-side spell stat blocks, each a
  Level:/Components:/Casting Time:/... list) sit in the same y-range --
  they mutually satisfy both overlap fractions and still get merged into
  one bogus tab-joined table row (e.g. PHB pp. 254, 272's "Mind Fog" and
  "Repel Wood" spells) -- not fixed as part of this B3 follow-up.
- `pipeline/owlsperch/segment/` -- the `segment` subcommand: `headings.py`
  defines the book-wide `Paragraph` stream (a page's `.txt` paragraphs
  joined with their `.meta.json` stats) and heading detection (font-size
  vs. the book's body median, or an all-caps short line); `anchors.py`
  detects spell/stat_block/feat/table pattern anchors; `splitter.py` walks
  the stream once to produce the final segment spans (anchors, plus
  `rules_section` for everything between them, split at headings);
  `runner.py` loads a book's text+meta, calls the splitter, and writes
  `segments/<book_id>/<seg_id>.json`.

See `docs/specs/2026-09-12-dnd-reference-site-spec.md` (especially "Scope
boundaries" and sections 4.1-4.4) for the full design, and
`docs/batches/2026-09-12-dnd-reference-site-batches.md` for the batch/build
order this and future work follows.

## Keeping this file useful

When the project takes shape, replace the "Current state" section with:

- The commands to build, lint, run tests, and run a single test.
- The high-level architecture: the main entry points, how the major modules relate, and any non-obvious conventions that require reading several files to understand.
